# Graph Explorations

Graph Explorations enables you to select objects and relationships from the knowledge base and add them to a graphical representation that you can then share with your colleagues.

You can also start an exploration from a Report graph.

## Add Relationships

Clicking on any object on the graph displays related information in the side panel. You can also list relationships with the "Relationships" tab. From this list, you can add any relationship to the graph by clicking the hover button.

## Remove Items

You can remove relationships from the graph by clicking on the hover button from the relationship list. Objects can be removed by clicking the red trash icon next to their name. Removing a node automatically removes associated relationships.
