# New Intelligence Source: Hatching Triage

Our CTI database includes a new source of technical intelligence with the integration of the European sandbox Hatching Triage. This new source will reinforce our coverage of the most active malware of the moment such as Cobalt Strike, Agent tesla, LokiBot or IcedID.

It provides our CTI database with IPs / domain names of Command & Control (C2) and hashes of about twenty malware. A blogpost will very soon give details of this new integration with our partner Hatching Triage, stay tuned!
