# New invitation feature in the User Center

The change of the invitation process makes it easier to : 

- Assigning multiple roles to users: Different roles can be assigned at the same time when sending the invitation.
- Adding a user known to SEKOIA.IO: You can add existing users in other communities directly to a new one without going through the email invitation and authentication process.
