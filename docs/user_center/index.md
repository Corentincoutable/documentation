# User Center

**User Center** will let you manage your account settings (profile, authentication, etc.), your “community” (their members and their associated permissions) and your “notifications”.

User Center will let you:

- [Account settings](account_settings.md): manage profile on SEKOIA.IO and configure your password.
- [Notifications](notifications.md): manage your notification rules and read access notification history.
- Manage your community: add or remove members and update their associated permissions in SEKOIA.IO.
